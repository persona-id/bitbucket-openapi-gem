  # unit tests for repositories_workspace_repo_slug_branch_restrictions_post
  # Create a branch restriction rule
  # Creates a new branch restriction rule for a repository.  &#x60;kind&#x60; describes what will be restricted. Allowed values include: &#x60;push&#x60;, &#x60;force&#x60;, &#x60;delete&#x60; and &#x60;restrict_merges&#x60;.  Different kinds of branch restrictions have different requirements:  * &#x60;push&#x60; and &#x60;restrict_merges&#x60; require &#x60;users&#x60; and &#x60;groups&#x60; to be   specified. Empty lists are allowed, in which case permission is   denied for everybody.  The restriction applies to all branches that match. There are two ways to match a branch. It is configured in &#x60;branch_match_kind&#x60;:  1. &#x60;glob&#x60;: Matches a branch against the &#x60;pattern&#x60;. A &#x60;&#39;*&#39;&#x60; in    &#x60;pattern&#x60; will expand to match zero or more characters, and every    other character matches itself. For example, &#x60;&#39;foo*&#39;&#x60; will match    &#x60;&#39;foo&#39;&#x60; and &#x60;&#39;foobar&#39;&#x60;, but not &#x60;&#39;barfoo&#39;&#x60;. &#x60;&#39;*&#39;&#x60; will match all    branches. 2. &#x60;branching_model&#x60;: Matches a branch against the repository&#39;s    branching model. The &#x60;branch_type&#x60; controls the type of branch    to match. Allowed values include: &#x60;production&#x60;, &#x60;development&#x60;,    &#x60;bugfix&#x60;, &#x60;release&#x60;, &#x60;feature&#x60; and &#x60;hotfix&#x60;.  The combination of &#x60;kind&#x60; and match must be unique. This means that two &#x60;glob&#x60; restrictions in a repository cannot have the same &#x60;kind&#x60; and &#x60;pattern&#x60;. Additionally, two &#x60;branching_model&#x60; restrictions in a repository cannot have the same &#x60;kind&#x60; and &#x60;branch_type&#x60;.  &#x60;users&#x60; and &#x60;groups&#x60; are lists of users and groups that are except from the restriction. They can only be configured in &#x60;push&#x60; and &#x60;restrict_merges&#x60; restrictions. The &#x60;push&#x60; restriction stops a user pushing to matching branches unless that user is in &#x60;users&#x60; or is a member of a group in &#x60;groups&#x60;. The &#x60;restrict_merges&#x60; stops a user merging pull requests to matching branches unless that user is in &#x60;users&#x60; or is a member of a group in &#x60;groups&#x60;. Adding new users or groups to an existing restriction should be done via &#x60;PUT&#x60;.  Note that branch restrictions with overlapping matchers is allowed, but the resulting behavior may be surprising.
